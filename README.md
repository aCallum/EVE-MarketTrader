# EVE-MarketTrader
Entry for The EVE Online API Challenge

EVE-MarketTrader is a standalone application that helps players of EVE Online make use of inter region trade routes. The desired waypoint route can then be sent directly to the client for directions to the buy/sell locations. Currently supported feartures:

  - Bi-region market scanning
  - Buy/Sell location Waypoint plotting (CREST API currently only supports solar systems, MarketTrader will work best when stations can be set using this endpoint)
  - Item name search
  - Favourite item list search
  

MarketTrader is prototyped in Unity (why? because that's what I know) and makes use of:

  - Unity uGUI
  - SQLite
  - EVE CREST API
  - EVE Static Data Export (SDE)
  - EVE Online Image Server

Standalone Windows application. OSX planned.
Created for [The EVE Online API Challenge].
